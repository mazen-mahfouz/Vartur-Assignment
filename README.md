# Vartur Admin Panel

## What is this project about?

This is a simple admin panel I made to display user data and posts. It uses Vue 3 and Vuetify for the interface.

The project has:
- A login system
- A main page with statistics
- A categories page to view users
- A products page to view posts

## How to use

1. To install:
```
npm install
```

2. To run:
```
npm run dev
```

3. To build:
```
npm run build
```

## How to login

Use these credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

## How it works

- When you login, you'll see a dashboard with statistics
- You can navigate using the sidebar menu
- In Categories you'll see cards with user information
- In Products you'll see a table with posts
- You can search and filter the information
